This project is a website for my dad's business, Owens Welding, and it is to serve as an online market where he can connect to customers from the internet. 
It will have a home page, order page, about us page, and a contact page.
The 3 features I plan to include are to:
1.Visualize data in a user-friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc.), this can be seen on the home page with the line chart of pricing with customization.
2.Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app. You can test this by entering data into the order forms when you go to the order page, click on drop-offs, and then enter your information into the form, and then you will be taken to a confirmation page, this will retrieve all of your data that you entered and ask if it is correct.
3.Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app. This will be seen after you confirm your data in the last step, it is the address of the business put into google maps and the location is shown on google maps.
