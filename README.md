This project is a website for my dad's business, Owens Welding, and it is to serve as an online market where he can connect to customers from the internet. 
It will have a home page, order page, about us page, and a contact page.
The 3 features I plan to include are to:
1.Visualize data in a user-friendly way. (e.g. graph, chart, etc.)
2.Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved).
3.Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
To run my project, just run the code and then explore freely.
